[ ] test LBSTIterator
[ ] test red black tree insert algorithm
[ ] test red black tree deletion algorithm
[ ] make it so that the binary search tree and red black tree operation 
    functions don't take arguments such as the "value_size" or "compare" function.
    Instead, make the function that creates a BST or a RBT take these parameters
    and keep them throughout the existence of the data structures.
